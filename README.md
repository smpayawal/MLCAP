Unveiling Insights: An In-Depth Analysis of Mobile Legends Player Feedback


## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for my Mobile Legends Comment Analysis project. I collected and analyzed user comments from the Google Play Store to uncover sentiments, topics, and correlations related to the popular game "Mobile Legends." Through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and data analysis, I aimed to gain insights into player sentiments, preferences, and potential improvements for the game.

## Key Objectives

- Conduct sentiment analysis on over 1 million user comments.
- Utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify recurring topics within discussions.
- Investigate correlations between sentiment, user scores, engagement metrics, and app versions.
- Present findings using informative visualizations and explanatory analysis.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Scraped 1M+ user comments from the Google Play Store.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed text data for analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Utilized NLP techniques to categorize comments as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - Investigated sentiment trends across app versions and discussion topics.

3. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Applied LDA to uncover underlying topics within player conversations.
   - Explored cross-analysis between sentiment and identified topics.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examined correlations between sentiment, user scores, and engagement metrics.
   - Visualized findings through scatter plots and heatmaps.

5. **Visual Representation:**
   - Created insightful visualizations to communicate complex relationships effectively.
   - Used Python libraries like seaborn and scikit-learn for visualization.
